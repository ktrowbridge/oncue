# Claude Handoff — Current

**Last updated:** June 21, 2026
**Current phase:** OnCue MVP UX Architecture — complete; ready for founder review

---

## Objective

Review and confirm the MVP UX Architecture before any Lovable implementation begins. The architecture document is founder-facing and requires explicit sign-off on the eight numbered assumptions before the next phase starts.

---

## Work Completed This Session

**MVP UX Architecture document created:**
- `docs/architecture/mvp-ux-architecture.md`
- Covers all seven requested sections: user journeys, product modes, page map, key screens, Timeline Intelligence, role-filtered views, MVP vs. Later
- Grounded entirely in the three authoritative Master Docs (Strategy, Architecture, MVP Spec)
- Eight assumptions identified and listed for founder confirmation

**Repository verification before work:**
- Working tree was clean; `main` tracked `origin/main` at `8fe8cfd`
- All three Master Docs read in full before writing

**GitHub connection status (prior session — confirmed):**
- Remote: `https://github.com/ktrowbridge/oncue.git`
- `ktrowbridge` active; `kevtrowbridge` preserved
- `main` tracks `origin/main`

## Verification

- Architecture document read back in full after writing — all seven sections present
- All content traceable to Master Docs (no invented strategy)
- Eight assumptions clearly labeled `[ASSUMPTION]` for founder review
- No implementation code written

---

## Visible and Testable

The architecture document is readable in VS Code at `docs/architecture/mvp-ux-architecture.md`.

No application interface exists. No Lovable project has been started.

## Review Status
Visible to founder: Yes — `docs/architecture/mvp-ux-architecture.md` in VS Code
Where to look: Open the file and review all seven sections; pay particular attention to Section 8 (Assumptions Requiring Founder Confirmation)
Founder review recommended: Yes — before any implementation begins
Next step: Founder reviews `docs/architecture/mvp-ux-architecture.md`, confirms or revises assumptions, then gives approval to begin Lovable implementation

---

## Risks / Unresolved Issues

- The authoritative `.gdoc` files in `_Master DOCS` (Google Drive) remain unreadable as plain text. This document was built from the three readable archive copies. If the current `.gdoc` versions contain updates not reflected in the archive copies, those updates are not captured here.
- Eight assumptions in Section 8 of the architecture document require founder confirmation before implementation begins. Until confirmed, they are architecture-only decisions that could change the scope and complexity of the implementation.

---

## Exact Next Step

**Founder action:** Open `docs/architecture/mvp-ux-architecture.md` in VS Code and review all sections. Focus especially on:

1. Section 1 — Role mapping (does Owner/Planner/Vendor/Client match your intent?)
2. Section 2 — Mode transition rules (does the Planning → Execution → Archived flow match your vision?)
3. Section 5 — Timeline Intelligence (is the rule-based vs. AI-assisted split correct?)
4. Section 7 — MVP vs. Later (are any deferred features actually required for initial validation?)
5. Section 8 — Assumptions (confirm or revise each of the eight numbered assumptions)

After review, return with corrections or confirmation. Then proceed to Lovable implementation.

---

## Successor Prompt (for Claude Code, after founder review)

```
Begin OnCue MVP implementation in Lovable.

The MVP UX Architecture is approved and located at:
docs/architecture/mvp-ux-architecture.md

Assumptions confirmed:
[List each confirmed assumption from Section 8 here before running this prompt]

Work only in: /Users/kevintrowbridge/SaaS Development/OnCue

Do not deploy. Do not push to GitHub without explicit approval.
Do not begin Supabase setup until the UX scaffolding is reviewed.

Start with:
1. Scaffold the Lovable project
2. Implement the Dashboard and Create Event screens
3. Implement the Timeline Editor shell (no intelligence yet — structure first)
4. Implement Wedding Day Mode shell (compact card layout)
5. Report what is visible and testable before proceeding further
```
